# Digital Apprenticeships Service

## Context

Functionality within ProviderCommitments requires Commitments Api v2 (https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-commitments/blob/master/src/CommitmentsV2/readme.md)

ProviderCommitments has no home or landing page. The user is typically redirected there at various points from Provider Apprenticeship Service (https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-providerapprenticeshipsservice)
